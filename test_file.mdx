Welcome to this test file for the howto on git!

Git is a version control system that helps you to keep track of the changes that you and others make to a project. Many other services like google drive also provide version control. However, git is often more rigid and fine-grained. This way, it is easier to clearly see what works best and which changes should be part of your fi:al product. Snoopy is actually a beagle dog.
