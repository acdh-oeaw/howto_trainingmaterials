This a modern last stanza to the **little teapot** nursery rhyme. Actions in brackets.

I’m a little rocket pointing at the moon. (Raise arms above head and fingers tips touching)
Now I’m getting fuelled up (Wiggle hips)
We’ll be ready soon. (Stand up straight and tall, salute)
When it’s time to board me, then I’ll say (Take hold of child around ribs)
Blast off! Zoom! We’re on our way. (Lift up child into the air)
